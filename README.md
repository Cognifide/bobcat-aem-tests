Contains integration tests and examples for Bobcat's AEM modules.

>Tests in this repo are still under development to be aligned with Bobcat 2.0 - for now to make them work, you need to have a working AEM instance and should have locally compiled [Bobcat sources](https://github.com/Cognifide/bobcat) from the `2.0.0-develop` branch.
